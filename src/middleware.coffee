# This middleware will automatically compile packages when they are requested.
# There is considerable overhead when compiling a package, so this middleware
# is not suitable for a production environment. There you should precompile
# the packages before you deploy the code to the server.
#
# The `packages` argument is an object whose keys are URL paths, and the
# values are the respective packages. Example:
#
#  stitch.middleware({ '/assets/app.js': stitch.createPackage(...) })

    # doesn't exist. If we're lucky some other handler will know what to do
    # (static provider for example), otherwise the server returns 404.
